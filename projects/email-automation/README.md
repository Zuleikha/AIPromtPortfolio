```

## Implementation Details

### Zapier Workflow Configuration

#### Trigger Setup
- **App:** Gmail
- **Trigger:** New Email in Mailbox
- **Mailbox:** customerservice@fidelity.com
- **Filter:** Exclude automated emails and internal communications

#### Step 1: Email Content Processing
```javascript
// JavaScript code in Zapier
const emailData = {
  subject: inputData.subject,
  body: inputData.body_plain,
  sender: inputData.from_email,
  received_time: inputData.date,
  thread_id: inputData.thread_id
};

// Clean and prepare content for AI analysis
const cleanedBody = emailData.body
  .replace(/\r\n/g, ' ')
  .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')
  .trim();

return {
  processed_email: emailData,
  cleaned_content: cleanedBody
};
```

#### Step 2: AI Classification via OpenAI API
```python
# Python code in Zapier
import requests
import json

def classify_email(email_content):
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    
    payload = {
        'model': 'gpt-4',
        'messages': [
            {
                'role': 'system',
                'content': EMAIL_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT
            },
            {
                'role': 'user',
                'content': f"Subject: {email_content['subject']}\nBody: {email_content['body']}"
            }
        ],
        'max_tokens': 1000,
        'temperature': 0.1
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions',
        headers=headers,
        json=payload
    )
    
    return response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```

#### Step 3: Smart Routing Logic
```javascript
// Routing logic based on classification
const routingRules = {
  'ACCOUNT_ACCESS': {
    team: 'Technical Support',
    urgency_multiplier: 1.2,
    specialist: false
  },
  'TRADING_ISSUES': {
    team: 'Trading Support',
    urgency_multiplier: 1.5,
    specialist: true
  },
  'BILLING_INQUIRY': {
    team: 'Billing Support',
    urgency_multiplier: 1.0,
    specialist: false
  },
  'COMPLIANCE': {
    team: 'Compliance Team',
    urgency_multiplier: 2.0,
    specialist: true
  },
  'COMPLAINT': {
    team: 'Customer Relations',
    urgency_multiplier: 1.8,
    specialist: true
  }
};

const routing = routingRules[classification.category];
const finalUrgency = classification.urgency_score * routing.urgency_multiplier;

return {
  assigned_team: routing.team,
  final_urgency: finalUrgency,
  requires_specialist: routing.specialist
};
```

#### Step 4: Response Generation
```python
def generate_response(classification, email_content):
    response_prompt = RESPONSE_GENERATION_PROMPT.format(
        original_email=email_content,
        email_category=classification['category'],
        urgency_level=classification['urgency'],
        customer_sentiment=classification['sentiment']
    )
    
    # Call OpenAI API for response generation
    response = openai_api_call(response_prompt)
    
    return {
        'draft_response': response,
        'confidence_score': classification['confidence_score'],
        'requires_review': classification['confidence_score'] < 85
    }
```

#### Step 5: Quality Assurance Gate
```javascript
// Quality check logic
const qualityGate = (response, classification) => {
  const autoSendCriteria = {
    confidence_threshold: 90,
    low_risk_categories: ['GENERAL_INFO', 'ACCOUNT_ACCESS'],
    sentiment_safe: ['POSITIVE', 'NEUTRAL'],
    urgency_safe: ['LOW', 'MEDIUM']
  };
  
  const canAutoSend = (
    response.confidence_score >= autoSendCriteria.confidence_threshold &&
    autoSendCriteria.low_risk_categories.includes(classification.category) &&
    autoSendCriteria.sentiment_safe.includes(classification.sentiment) &&
    autoSendCriteria.urgency_safe.includes(classification.urgency)
  );
  
  return {
    auto_send: canAutoSend,
    review_required: !canAutoSend,
    review_priority: classification.urgency === 'CRITICAL' ? 'immediate' : 'standard'
  };
};
```

### Performance Monitoring Dashboard

#### Key Metrics Tracked
```python
# Metrics collection in Google Sheets via Zapier
metrics_data = {
    'timestamp': datetime.now(),
    'email_id': email_thread_id,
    'classification_category': classification.category,
    'confidence_score': classification.confidence,
    'processing_time': end_time - start_time,
    'auto_sent': quality_gate.auto_send,
    'human_review_required': quality_gate.review_required,
    'customer_satisfaction': None  # Updated after customer feedback
}
```

    metrics = {
        'total_emails_processed': count_emails_last_week(),
        'classification_accuracy': calculate_accuracy(),
        'auto_response_rate': calculate_auto_rate(),
        'customer_satisfaction': get_satisfaction_scores(),
        'error_analysis': analyze_misclassifications(),
        'improvement_recommendations': generate_recommendations()
    }
    
    return create_executive_dashboard(metrics)
```
