- Address: [Complete address if visible]

PRESCRIPTION DETAILS:
- Medication Name: [Generic and brand names]
- Dosage: [Strength and form]
- Quantity: [Number of units]
- Instructions: [Dosing frequency and special instructions]
- Refills: [Number of refills authorized]

PRESCRIBER INFORMATION:
- Doctor Name: [Full name]
- License Number: [If visible]
- DEA Number: [If controlled substance]

QUALITY CHECKS:
- Legibility Score: [1-10 scale]
- Confidence Level: [High/Medium/Low]
- Flags: [Any concerns or unclear elements]

If any information is unclear or missing, mark as "NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW" and specify which elements require clarification.
"""
```

#### 2. Intelligent Validation Workflow
```python
# Drug Interaction Checking Prompt
DRUG_INTERACTION_PROMPT = """
Analyze potential drug interactions for this prescription:

CURRENT PRESCRIPTION: {medication_name}, {dosage}
PATIENT MEDICATIONS: {existing_medications}
PATIENT ALLERGIES: {known_allergies}

INTERACTION ANALYSIS:
1. Severity Level: [None/Minor/Moderate/Major/Severe]
2. Interaction Type: [Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic/Contraindication]
3. Clinical Significance: [Detailed explanation]
4. Recommendation: [Proceed/Caution/Alternative/Contraindicated]

If interaction severity is Moderate or higher, provide:
- Alternative medications
- Dosage adjustments
- Monitoring requirements
- Patient counseling points
"""
```

#### 3. Automated Quality Assurance
```python
# Quality Control Prompt
QA_VALIDATION_PROMPT = """
Review this processed prescription for accuracy and completeness:

ORIGINAL PRESCRIPTION: [OCR text]
PROCESSED DATA: [Structured output]

VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
□ Patient information accuracy
□ Medication name correctness
□ Dosage appropriateness
□ Quantity reasonableness
□ Instructions clarity
□ Prescriber authorization

SCORING:
- Accuracy Score: [0-100%]
- Completeness Score: [0-100%]
- Confidence Level: [High/Medium/Low]

DECISION:
- APPROVE: All checks passed, confidence >95%
- REVIEW: Minor issues identified, human verification needed
- REJECT: Major errors detected, requires pharmacist intervention

Provide specific reasons for any REVIEW or REJECT decisions.
"""
```

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **OCR Engine:** Azure Computer Vision API

2. Structured data extraction with validation rules
3. Drug interaction checking against patient history
4. Dosage validation based on FDA guidelines

#### Stage 3: Quality Assurance
1. Automated quality scoring using validation prompts
2. High-confidence prescriptions proceed to fulfillment
3. Medium-confidence items flagged for pharmacist review
4. Low-confidence items require manual processing

#### Stage 4: Fulfillment Integration
1. Approved prescriptions sent to inventory management
2. Automated insurance verification and processing
3. Pick list generation for pharmacy staff
4. Patient notification system activation

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

#### Iterative Prompt Development
```python
# Version 1: Basic extraction (78% accuracy)
basic_prompt = "Extract medication name, dosage, and quantity from this prescription."

# Version 2: Structured format (85% accuracy)
structured_prompt = """
Extract the following from the prescription:
1. Medication: 
2. Dosage:
3. Quantity:
4. Instructions:
"""

# Version 3: Context-aware with validation (92% accuracy)
context_prompt = """
As a pharmaceutical expert, analyze this prescription considering:
- Standard medication nomenclature
- Typical dosing patterns
- Common prescription formats
[Full structured template with validation rules]
"""

# Final Version: Comprehensive with error handling (99.2% accuracy)
final_prompt = """
